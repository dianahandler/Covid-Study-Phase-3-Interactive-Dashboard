Covid-Study-Phase-3-Interactive-Dashboard

This interactive dashboard consists of data from our IMPACC study. individual patient information was excluded to maintain confidentiality. Each plate consists of up to 20 blood samples of COVID-infected patients. These samples were stained with our proprietary IMPACC antibody cocktail and analyzed through our CyTOF mass cytometer in order to profile the immune cells in each sample.

Before performing this assay, all blood samples are given a routine quality check. Samples that are dark and have a high viscosity are thrown out and are thus excluded from the final analysis. Poor-quality samples are discarded because few cells are ever successfully identified from them and the viscous, clumpy state of the samples can clog the CyTOF machine, negatively affecting the overall analysis of all 20 samples.

An interactive dashboard was developed in order to understand the quantity of samples thrown out per plate in the third phase of this study.
